<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of target-times-scales-covid is to demonstrate the use of renv, targets and friends.

The rmarkdown document is taken from my own blog post:

[Fancy Times and Scales with COVID data](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2020/10/11/times-scales-covid/)

# Using `renv`

1. run `renv::restore()`
2. Knit the "fancy-covid-times.Rmd" document


# Alternative way 1: Capsule


# Alternative way 2: Capsule + targets
